1,combination,"(Type 1) If the “wash your face and leave it for two hours” test gives you different results in January than it does in July, you’re probably a seasonal combo type. (Type 2) If you get oily in some places and tight in others, you probably have a combination of skin types on your face."
2,dry,"Dry skin often feels tight, flaky, or itchy. If you wash your face and don’t apply any products, after a couple of hours your skin will feel dry or tight instead of oily."
3,normal,"Your skin rarely feels either tight or greasy. Your skin doesn’t flake off, nor does it get shiny by the end of the day."
4,oily,"If you wash your face and don’t put on any products, your skin will feel oily and shiny within a couple of hours. (Note: in many cases, people assume they have an oily skin type when they actually have a dehydrated skin condition, and their oiliness can actually be treated and managed.)"
5,sensitive,"There are two types of sensitivity: irritation (which usually manifests as redness, stinging, small painless bumps, or discomfort to touch) and allergy (which manifests as swelling, itching, or rashes). If you get either of those responses frequently, or if products that most people can use without issue cause an irritation or allergy response in your skin, you may have sensitive skin."
