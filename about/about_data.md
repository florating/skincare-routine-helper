# About the Data

## Datasets in This Project
All datasets used in this project were obtained from one of the following resources. If unlisted below, some of these datasets were put together by me after synthesizing the information from reputable sources (including but not limited to the ones listed below).

These files are listed by file name, and are in the `/data` directory unless otherwise specified:

1. `/data/production_datasets/skincare_products_clean_url.csv`
    - source: [eward96 on Kaggle](#kaggle:-erin-ward)
    - ~700 KB, 1138 products, 14 product types
    - unused fields: price, product_url
    - note: the list of ingredients excludes water

2. `/database/ka-1-*`
    - source: [eward96 on Kaggle](#kaggle:-erin-ward) + my actions below
    - processed and generated by me using original, un-processed dataset (from above)
    - found the cardinal position of water/aqua/eau in each product's ingredient list
        - excluded ingredients like "flower water"
    - created individual CSV/XLSX files for the following categories:
        - `ka-1-water0.csv`: 26 products with no water
        - `ka-1-water1.csv`: 689 products where water is the 1st ingredient
        - `ka-1-water2.csv`: 47 products where water is the 2nd ingredient
        - `ka-1-water3.csv`: 14 products where water is the 3rd ingredient
    - used `pandas` to add 'water' back to the cleaned ingredient list via `merge`, which was used to overwrite the aforementioned filenames
    - seeded 776 products in `project_test_2` (test db)

3. `/data/sample_dasets/users.csv`
    - auto-generated 100 users
    - source: [mockaroo](https://www.mockaroo.com/)

## Information/Datasets from Official Organizations

### **California Safe Cosmetics Program (CSCP)**
- [main website](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/OHB/CSCP/Pages/CSCP.aspx)
- This program implements the California Safe Cosmetics Act that was signed into law in 2005. This law requires that "the manufacturer, packer, and/or distributor named on the product label to provide to the California Department of Public Health (CDPH) a list of all cosmetic products that contain any ingredients known or suspected to cause cancer or developmental or other reproductive harm". [source](https://www.cdph.ca.gov/Programs/CCDPHP/DEODC/OHB/CSCP/Pages/About-CSCP.aspx)
- 25 MB file containing 115646 individual product entries
- products are reported by each company voluntarily

**data processing:**

This dataset was filtered to remove:
- non-skincare products
- products that were discontinued prior to 2019

**datasets:**
- [XLSX file with list of reportable ingredients](https://cscpsubmit.cdph.ca.gov/submission/assets/files/Reportable_Ingredients_List_-_June_2021.xlsx) - last updated on July 21, 2021
- [CSV file via CHHS Open Data](https://data.chhs.ca.gov/dataset/chemicals-in-cosmetics)

### **Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR)**
- "The Cosmetic Ingredient Review was established in 1976 by the industry trade association (then the Cosmetic, Toiletry, and Fragrance Association, now the Personal Care Products Council), with the support of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the Consumer Federation of America." Despite being funded by the Personal Care Products Council, "CIR, the Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety, and the review process are independent from the Council and the cosmetics industry. CIR and the Expert Panel for Cosmetic Ingredient Safety operate under a set of [procedures](https://www.cir-safety.org/supplementaldoc/cir-procedures)." [source](https://www.cir-safety.org/about)
- [Findings](https://www.cir-safety.org/cir-findings) for ingredients that:
    - are [prohibited/restricted by the FDA](https://www.cir-safety.org/supplementaldoc/prohibited/restricted-fda)
    - are [unsafe](https://cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/U-breakout-092020r.pdf)
    - have [zero uses](https://cir-safety.org/sites/default/files/Z-breakout-092020-r.pdf) in cosmetics and related products

### **International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)**
- This is the specialized cancer agency of the World Health Organization (WHO).
- 1091 agents deemed carcinogenic by the IARC, [divided by group](https://monographs.iarc.who.int/agents-classified-by-the-iarc/):
    - **Group 1:** carcinogenic to humans (121 agents)
    - **Group 2A:** probably carcinogenic to humans (89 agents)
    - **Group 2B:** possibly carcinogenic to humans (319 agents)
    - **Group 3:** not classifiable as to its carcinogenicity to humans (500 agents)
        - despite lack of evidence of cancer in humans, these agents all have **strong** mechanistic evidence of cancer in non-human studies, and have also shown **sufficient** evidence of cancer in experimental animals
    - PDF with definitions for each group is available from the revised preamble [here](https://monographs.iarc.who.int/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/2019-SR-001-Revised_Preamble.pdf)

### Health Canada
- The federal department of Canada has much stricter cosmetics regulations than those in the United States.
- 2019 datasets:
    - [ingredients prohibited for use in cosmetic products](https://www.canada.ca/en/health-canada/services/consumer-product-safety/cosmetics/cosmetic-ingredient-hotlist-prohibited-restricted-ingredients/hotlist.html#tbl1)
